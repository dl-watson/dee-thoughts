      <description>hey y&amp;rsquo;all, thanks for visiting
i&amp;rsquo;m hoping that having a place to do blogging will serve as a motivator to, y&amp;rsquo;know, do blogging
it&amp;rsquo;s been difficult as someone very new to the tech world to convince myself that i have anything meaningful to offer, but hey, maybe not everything has to be meaningful or marketable, and maybe i can just be playful
alright. okay. that&amp;rsquo;s doable.</description>
