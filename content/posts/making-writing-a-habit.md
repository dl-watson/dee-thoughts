hi there, and welcome to my *new* ðŸŽ‰ **b l o g** ðŸŽ‰

i'll be treating this space as a place to catch whatever words feel meaningful in a moment to put down. you'll most likely see a lot about my daily experiences in life and at the recurse center, probably a bit about code, and probably a lot about what i'm reading or feeling or thinking about more broadly 

introspection is important to me, and i'd like to---nervously---share some of what that journey means to me through this medium. 

i'll be spending as little time editing as possible, in an attempt to mitigate my habit of anxious editorializing. 

most important: this practice is for me. (not for you. (sorry).)
